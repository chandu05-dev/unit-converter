# unit-converter
1. This is a simple project written in Java to convert a given value in one unit (LIKE mil|in|inch|ft|foot|feet|yd|yard|mi|mile) to requested unit.

2. I have primarily worked on writing the code as well as writing 16 testcases with a code coverage of 99.1% as part of my curriculum.
